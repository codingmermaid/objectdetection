<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<h2>Object Detection with Neural Network</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates how to implement an object detection model using a neural network. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. It's ideal for beginners who want to explore the MNIST dataset or apply some kind of transfer learning like AlexNet or ResNet and run benchmarks against their self-built NN model. The document uses TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas and Sklearn</p>
